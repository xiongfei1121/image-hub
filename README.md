**English** | [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

A browser-side image toolbox: **image compression** (libcaesium WASM engine), **format
conversion**, **cropping**, **resize**, **image merging**, **watermarking**, plus **AI
super-resolution upscaling** and **AI background removal** (both on ONNX Runtime). Everything
runs on the visitor's own device — images are never uploaded, never leave the machine — and the
output is a pile of static files, so **no backend is required**.

## Features

All tools share one page shell with a segmented tab switcher in the header (instant, same
bundle — no full page reload), and each keeps its own URL so they can be bookmarked and linked
separately.

### 1. Compression — `/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | libcaesium WASM (the compression core from [image-hub](https://github.com/xiongfei1121/image-hub)) — runs entirely in the browser, no upload, no server |
| Modes | **Quality-first** (quality slider, lossless toggle) or **Target size** (re-compresses until the output fits a size budget) |
| Options | Lossless mode, keep EXIF/other metadata |
| Resize | None / exact dimensions / percentage / short edge / long edge / fixed width / fixed height |
| Inputs | JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP — output keeps the original format |
| Batch | Multi-select, drag & drop, folders; files are queued and processed one by one |
| Results | Live preview, size-reduction percentage, per-file download and "Download all" |

Default quality: 80 (quality-first mode).

### 2. Format conversion — `/convert/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Formats | JPG / PNG / WebP inter-conversion |
| Options | Output quality slider (default 90%) |
| Batch | Multi-select, drag & drop; convert all or per-file, download all as a ZIP package |

### 3. Cropping — `/crop/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Selection | Drag on canvas; ratio lock (1:1, 4:3, 3:4, 16:9, 9:16, 2:3, 3:2) or free |
| Presets | 800×600 / 1024×768 / 1920×1080 / 1080×1920 / 500×500 / 300×300, or manual width × height |
| Output | PNG / JPG / WebP |

### 4. Resize — `/resize/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Modes | By pixels (width/height) or by percentage |
| Ratio | Keep aspect ratio toggle |
| Transform | Rotate ±90° / 180°, flip horizontally / vertically |
| Output | PNG / JPG / WebP |

### 5. Image merging — `/merge/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Canvas | Configurable size (1920×1080 default), auto-fit to content, background color |
| Layout | Free drag + snap-to-edge alignment, or automatic: horizontal / vertical / 2×2 grid / 3×3 grid |
| Tools | Gap spacing, global zoom, grid display, arrow-key fine movement, Delete to remove |
| Export | PNG download |

### 6. Watermarking — `/watermark/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Types | Text watermark (font size / color / opacity / rotation) or image watermark |
| Position | 9-grid placement, tile the whole image |
| Export | Rendered PNG download |

### 7. AI upscaling — `/upscale/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Model | Real-ESRGAN General x4v3 (single-file ONNX, 4.76 MB, committed to the repo) |
| Scale | 4× (tiled inference, resampled to the selected factor) |
| Backend | **WebGPU preferred**, automatic fallback to WASM (multi-threaded → single-threaded) |
| Flow | Upload → pick model → before/after comparison slider → download |

### 8. AI background removal — `/cutout/`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Model | BiRefNet (512×512 input, one forward pass over the whole image, single-channel alpha mask out) |
| Variants | Lite 94 MB (default) / Full 452 MB (fallback for devices without WebGPU) |
| Weights | **Not committed** — fetched from the HuggingFace Hub at a pinned revision and cached in Cache Storage |
| Backend | **WebGPU preferred**, automatic fallback to WASM (multi-threaded → single-threaded) |
| Edges | Two modes: "sharp" narrows the transition band, "soft" keeps the original feathering |
| Backdrop | Transparent / white / red / blue — switching only recomposites, no re-inference |
| Flow | Upload → choose model and edge mode → run → comparison slider → pick a backdrop → download PNG |

Cutout and upscaling share a single ONNX Runtime instance (`public/ort/`) —
**no second inference engine is bundled**.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | React 19 + TypeScript 6 |
| Build | Vite 8 (MPA, 9 HTML entries) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, CSS-first) |
| Compression | [libcaesium](https://github.com/Librerouter/Libcaesium) WASM engine (from [image-hub](https://github.com/xiongfei1121/image-hub)) |
| Inference | [onnxruntime-web](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) 1.30 (WebGPU / WASM) |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| Zip | jszip (batch download of converted results) |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages (fully static) |

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haihaipypy/image-tools.git
cd image-tools
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` runs `prepare:ort` once to stage the ONNX Runtime assets, then starts Vite.
**There is no backend to start.**

Requirements: Node.js `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0` (Vite 8's engine constraint), npm 7+.

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Stage ORT assets + start the dev server (with COOP/COEP headers) |
| `npm run build` | Stage ORT assets + type-check + build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` | Types / ESLint |
| `npm run deploy` | Build + `wrangler pages deploy` |

## Deploying

### Option 1: Cloudflare Pages connected to Git (recommended)

1. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Pages** → **Connect to Git**
2. Authorize and pick the `haihaipypy/image-tools` repo
3. Build settings:

   | Setting | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Framework preset | None (or Vite) |
   | Build command | `npm run build` |
   | Build output directory | `dist` |
   | Root directory | leave empty |

4. **Add an environment variable `NODE_VERSION = 22`** — Vite 8 needs Node `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`,
   and the build image's default may not satisfy that.
5. Hit **Deploy** and wait for the logs.

`wrangler.toml` (`pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"`) is already in place.

### Option 2: wrangler locally

```bash
npm run deploy     # = npm run build && wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=image-tools
```

Run `npx wrangler login` first (or set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in CI).

### Option 3: Any static host

There is no server-side code — just upload `dist/` to EdgeOne Pages, Netlify, nginx, and so on.
Two hard requirements:

- **You must be able to set custom response headers.** `public/_headers` is a Cloudflare format;
  other platforms need their own equivalent (Netlify uses a same-named `_headers`, nginx uses
  `add_header`, EdgeOne uses response-header rules). **`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` +
  `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` must actually take effect**, otherwise machines
  without WebGPU drop to single-threaded WASM and run several times slower.
  **GitHub Pages cannot do this — don't use it.**
- **Don't forget to upload `dist/ort/` and `dist/models/`.** The cutout weights are not in `dist/` —
  they are fetched from HuggingFace at runtime and cached, so there is nothing to prepare.

**On Upscayl.** The upscaling interaction design takes inspiration from
[Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl), but **the code is a rewrite that copies none of its
source**, and the inference layer is entirely different (ONNX Runtime in the browser rather than
Electron with native ncnn binaries). This project is therefore not subject to Upscayl's AGPL-3.0
copyleft.

**On bg0.** The cutout interaction and API design takes inspiration from
[bg0](https://github.com/opencoredev/bg0) (Apache-2.0), but **the inference layer is an independent
implementation**. The dependency tree contains neither `@huggingface/transformers` nor
`@bg0/browser`.

**<https://img.1day.vip/en/docs/license.html>**.
